# Analyise-Summarize-Trump-s-remarks-on-state-of-the-Union-Houses

[Automatic text summarization, is the process of creating a short, concise and coherent version of a longer document. It is one of the most interesting and challenging problems in the field of NLP.](https://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-text-summarization/)

Since Donald Trump delivered his State of the Union address last night, “Key takeaways”, “Fact check”, “Analysis”, “Reactions” are all over the news media. Automatic text summarization methods are greatly needed to address the ever-growing amount of text data available online to both better help discover relevant information and to consume relevant information faster..
So, instead of  listening entire speech for 82 minutes, lets explore realms of Text Summarization and build a Text Summarizer.

## The Data: 
 The data can be found on [The White House Website](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-state-union-address-2/)

Pre_trained word vectors are used to create vectors for the sentences in the State of Union address. Download it from [Glove](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)

## Everything you need to recreate this project is on the jupyter notebook.
